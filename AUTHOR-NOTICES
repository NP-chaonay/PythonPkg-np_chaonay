# Changes Pushing
- Revised Date must be always updated.
- Version changing required tag must be specificied when needed.
- Recommended to not change the version.
# Release Publishing
- Checking for changed files, changing the version of those.
- Changing the version in README, LICENSE, setup.py, and others related.
- Changing on files on np_chaonay/, setup.py, README; requires release publishing when ready, else no need to upgrade package version.
- For general case, this command speeds up: "nano README.md np_chaonay/__init__.py setup.py CHANGELOG"
