[License Changing History]
REMARK: the license change doesn't apply to prior commit from commit which the license is changed
REMARK: noted using github-repository commit id
(<Current>): Fixed conflicted statement on section "License Changing History"
(8892b5a2b22a1253ad9b47b86056003265c915b3): Improved credit informations and misc editing of "License Changing History"
(51cb35b254f9ea1442ee4d93aee904f8ab77249c): Additional improvement, many statements changed but maybe no significant effects on the repository.
(6dd91916846e9e0205dd1fd67e112aee6ccbc748): Adding statement: author-and-contributors, additional-remarks; however this commit and previous one have same effects (because no any components using different license from the specified main one, and additional author information have no difference from the previous license file.)
(808bb6a335956cad1d56ae204a5029f5c898b847): Entire repo is licensed by MIT license (initial commit)
